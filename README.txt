Official Chat Module for Moodle
------------------------------

Version 0.1  (for Moodle 1.1)

This module is still very new and very incomplete compared
to the version that will be shipping with Moodle 1.1

It's based in part on ARSC but I ended up rewriting so much 
of it there's hardly a line of code in use that has not
been changed, so perhaps it's *inspired* by ARSC.

It's fairly useful already and should work with most newer browers.

Note it supports user images, smilies and even HTML already.

Things to do yet:

  - fix up the other chat front-end version (currently only using 
    header_js)

  - make the socket server work

  - more useful shortcuts in the user interface

  - postgresql support (db schema)
